Introducing The Drifter: A Mighty Affinity Neutral Hero Class!

Embark on a journey with the all-new neutral hero class - The Drifter. These enigmatic heroes have a special affinity for neutral creatures, bringing a fresh dynamic to your gameplay.

Drifters can be found and hired exclusively in Taverns (both in towns and on the adventure map) or rescued from Prisons. While they might seem limited on random maps, they truly shine on custom maps, with the unique gameplay they offer.

To enhance their usefulness, all Drifters possess not just one, but two specialties! Alongside their mastery of creatures, they also excel in resources, spells, and other fascinating aspects of the game.

Version 1.0 offers three separate submods, each with its own focus:
- H3 Neutral Heroes: Meet eight new Drifters, each with specialties in standard H3 neutral creatures.
- WoG Neutral Heroes: Discover eleven new Drifters with specialties in WoG neutral creatures (excluding Dracoliches).
- HotA Neutral Heroes: Unveil two new Drifters, experts in HotA neutral creatures.
  
This universal mod can be effortlessly expanded to include new Drifters tailored to any mod featuring new Neutral Creatures. Mod authors are also empowered to configure and link their mods with Neutral Heroes to create their unique Drifters.

For more details, refer to the attached neutralHeroes.pdf. Please note that using the additional WoG and HotA heroes requires the corresponding WoG and HotA mods for VCMI.
